Employers sometimes ask people applying for jobs for personal information, such as hobbies and interest,
and whether they are married or single.

Some people say that this information is relevant and useful. Others disagree.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Agree:
--whether the person can work on shifts or not.
--in order to know about his location preference
--For example: people often ask transfers which creates pressure on employers.
--to know about his commitment towards the company.

Disagree:
-- in the interviews,
-- people scrutinize in the office (work pressure), if the personal info is shared.
-- your job will be at risk ,if the employers knows that hiring this employee is just 
a waste of time as there is no commitment
To Illustrate, stating his ambitions during his interview may lose the employers interest of hiring him.

During the Interviews, many employers ask the attendees to share their personal information such as their interests, marital status
and their daily work schedules. Some people think asking these type of questions is beneficial and necessary while others think
it is irrelevant. In my opinion sharing information with the employers is quite useful but one should be wise enough to know 
which type of data should be shared in order to avoid the possible risks.

On the one side, by knowing the personal details of his employee, Interviewer will come to know whether he/she is willing to work 
on shifts or not if needed. Moreover, some do it, in order to know the location preference of the attendee. For example, many people
often requests their employers for transfers after their immediate joining which creates a lot of pressures on them. In addition to that,
they even want to know the commitment of the employee towards the company based on his interests and ambitions.

On the other side, people disagree that this type of information should not be asked and shared during the job interviews because 
of the scrutiny they may face in the office and to avoid their job at risks. Firstly, people scrutinize the employees if their personal
information is shared with their employees by increasing the work pressure. Secondly, his/her job will be at risk, if the employer
knows about this personal endeavours. To Illustrate, stating his ambitions during the job interview may lose the employers interest
of hiring him, assuming that he/her has no commitment.

In conclusion, people has different opinions on sharing the information with the employers during the job interviews. But in my 
opinion,providing your personal data with the Interviewer is important and advantageous which helps to provide a complete 
overview of one needs and requirement to the employer before hand but it should be restricted so as to avoid job risks.
